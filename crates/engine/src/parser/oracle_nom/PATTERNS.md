# Nom Combinator Patterns — Copy-Paste Reference

**This document exists because writing nom combinators correctly the first time
is faster than writing string-matching code and refactoring it after review.**
When the parser combinator gate (`scripts/check-parser-combinators.sh`) flags
your diff, find the matching pattern below and use it directly.

The CLAUDE.md mandate: **all parsing dispatch must use nom combinators**. No
`.strip_prefix(...)`, `.strip_suffix(...)`, `.contains("...")`, `.starts_with("...")`,
`.ends_with("...")`, `.split_once(...)`, `.find("...")`, or `.trim_end_matches("...")`
on string literals in `crates/engine/src/parser/`. Existing offenders are frozen
in amber via the diff-based gate; new code uses these patterns instead.

All examples assume the standard import set:

```rust
use nom::branch::alt;
use nom::bytes::complete::{tag, take_until, take_while1};
use nom::character::complete::{multispace0, multispace1};
use nom::combinator::{map, opt, recognize, value};
use nom::multi::{many0, many1, separated_list1};
use nom::sequence::{delimited, pair, preceded, terminated, tuple};
use nom::Parser;
```

For Oracle text (mixed-case input), prefer the bridge helpers in
`oracle_nom/bridge.rs`: `nom_on_lower`, `nom_on_lower_required`. For atomic
parsing of numbers, mana, counters, etc., use `oracle_nom/primitives.rs`.

## 1. Strip optional fixed prefix

**Was**:
```rust
let body = input.strip_prefix("at the beginning of ").unwrap_or(input);
```

**Use**:
```rust
let (body, _) = opt(tag("at the beginning of ")).parse(input)?;
// body is the remainder; the `_` is Option<&str> indicating presence.
```

If you need to know whether the prefix was present, capture the option:
```rust
let (body, prefix) = opt(tag("at the beginning of ")).parse(input)?;
let was_present = prefix.is_some();
```

---

## 2. Strip optional fixed suffix

Nom is forward-parsing — it has no native "consume from the end". Two clean
forms exist; pick the one that matches your shape.

### 2a. The string is the entire parse — terminate with the suffix

**Was**:
```rust
let body = input.strip_suffix(" until end of turn").unwrap_or(input);
```

**Use** when you're parsing the whole string and the suffix is fixed:
```rust
let (_, body) = terminated(
    take_until(" until end of turn"),
    opt(tag(" until end of turn")),
).parse(input)?;
```

### 2b. The string is consumed by an upstream combinator that halts before the suffix

This is the more common case in this codebase. See pattern 3.

---

## 3. Optional trailing clause after a token sequence

**Canonical example**: parsing `"Horror enchantment creature in addition to its other types"`.
The type-token sequence (`Horror enchantment creature`) halts naturally at
`in` (not a known type). The trailing clause is then optionally consumed.

**Was** (forbidden):
```rust
let trimmed = descriptor
    .strip_suffix(" in addition to its other types")
    .or_else(|| descriptor.strip_suffix(" in addition to its other creature types"))
    .unwrap_or(descriptor);
let tokens = parse_animation_type_sequence(trimmed)?;
```

**Use**:
```rust
let mut parser = (
    parse_animation_type_sequence,
    opt(preceded(
        multispace0,
        // Try the LONGER alternative first — alt() is short-circuit.
        alt((
            tag("in addition to its other creature types"),
            tag("in addition to its other types"),
        )),
    )),
);
let (_, (tokens, _trailer)) = parser.parse(descriptor)?;
```

**Critical**: in `alt()`, longer alternatives that share a prefix MUST come
first. `tag("foo bar")` will never match if `tag("foo")` precedes it.

---

## 4. Match one of N alternatives (literal dispatch)

**Was**:
```rust
if input == "destroy" || input == "exile" || input == "sacrifice" {
    ...
}
```

**Use** for parsing dispatch:
```rust
let (rest, verb) = alt((
    value(Verb::Destroy, tag("destroy")),
    value(Verb::Exile, tag("exile")),
    value(Verb::Sacrifice, tag("sacrifice")),
)).parse(input)?;
```

`value(X, parser)` runs `parser` and returns `X` on success — perfect for
mapping literal phrases to typed enum arms.

---

## 5. Word-boundary scan for a phrase that may appear anywhere

When a phrase like a timing restriction can appear at any position in the
string (not just the start), and you need to find it without committing to
a position.

**Was** (forbidden):
```rust
while let Some(pos) = remaining.find("during your upkeep") { ... }
```

**Use** the codebase's established pattern (see `scan_timing_restrictions`
in `oracle_casting.rs` and `scan_for_phase` in `oracle_trigger.rs`):

```rust
fn scan_for_clause<'a, F, T>(
    mut remaining: &'a str,
    mut combinator: F,
) -> Vec<T>
where
    F: FnMut(&'a str) -> nom::IResult<&'a str, T>,
{
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    while !remaining.is_empty() {
        if let Ok((rest, val)) = combinator(remaining) {
            results.push(val);
            remaining = rest.trim_start();
        } else {
            // Advance to the next word boundary.
            // allow-noncombinator: word-boundary skip, not parsing dispatch.
            remaining = match remaining.find(' ') {
                Some(i) => remaining[i + 1..].trim_start(),
                None => "",
            };
        }
    }
    results
}
```

This idiom is the single allowed use of `.find(' ')` — it's word-boundary
advancement, not pattern matching. Annotate the line.

---

## 6. Split on a delimiter (was: `split_once`)

**Was**:
```rust
let (before, after) = input.split_once(" — ")?;
```

**Use**:
```rust
let (after, before) = terminated(
    take_until(" — "),
    tag(" — "),
).parse(input)?;
// Note: `before` is the parsed output, `after` is the remainder.
```

If the delimiter is optional, wrap in `opt`:
```rust
let (rest, parts) = opt((take_until(" — "), tag(" — "))).parse(input)?;
match parts {
    Some((before, _delim)) => /* delimited form */,
    None => /* whole input is `before`, no delimiter present */,
}
```

---

## 7. Check whether a pattern is present (was: `.contains("…")`)

**Avoid this pattern entirely for parsing dispatch.** If you find yourself
asking "does the string contain X", rewrite to "parse forward until I hit
X (if I do)":

**Was** (forbidden):
```rust
if input.contains(" until end of turn") {
    duration = Duration::UntilEndOfTurn;
}
```

**Use**: integrate into the actual parse:
```rust
let (rest, duration) = opt(preceded(
    multispace0,
    value(Duration::UntilEndOfTurn, tag("until end of turn")),
)).parse(remaining_after_effect)?;
```

The `opt` makes the duration optional; absence yields `None`. This is
order-of-magnitude better than a pre-pass `.contains()` because the parse
both *detects* and *consumes* the clause in one step.

---

## 8. Composing alt() — branch by shared prefix

When multiple branches share a prefix (e.g. `"during your upkeep"`,
`"during your end step"`, `"during your turn"`), nest them. Don't expand
the cross product.

**Bad** (cross-product expansion):
```rust
alt((
    tag("during your upkeep"),
    tag("during your end step"),
    tag("during your turn"),
    tag("during an opponent's upkeep"),
    tag("during an opponent's end step"),
    tag("during an opponent's turn"),
))
```

**Good** (nested by prefix):
```rust
preceded(
    tag("during "),
    alt((
        preceded(tag("your "), parse_player_phase_phrase),
        preceded(tag("an opponent's "), parse_opponent_phase_phrase),
    )),
)
```

This mirrors BNF grammar production rules and eliminates redundant prefix
matching. When you find yourself writing `tag("X foo")` and `tag("X bar")`
in the same `alt`, factor `X` into a `preceded`.

### 8b. Multi-axis cross product — variation in the *middle*, not just the prefix

Pattern 8 handles a single varying axis at the *front*. When two or more
independent axes vary at *different positions* in the phrase — and especially
when one axis is optional — `preceded` alone isn't enough. Build the fixed
scaffold with a sequence and give **each axis its own single `alt` / `opt`**,
then wrap in `recognize` if the caller needs the consumed slice. Never multiply
the axes out into one flat `alt` of full-string `tag`s.

**Bad** (4 possessives × {`creature `, ∅} scopes = 8 enumerated arms):
```rust
alt((
    tag("in addition to its other creature types"),
    tag("in addition to their other creature types"),
    tag("in addition to his other creature types"),
    tag("in addition to her other creature types"),
    tag("in addition to its other types"),
    tag("in addition to their other types"),
    tag("in addition to his other types"),
    tag("in addition to her other types"),
))
```

**Good** (one `alt` for the pronoun axis, one `opt` for the scope axis):
```rust
recognize((
    tag("in addition to "),
    alt((tag("its"), tag("their"), tag("his"), tag("her"))), // axis 1
    tag(" other "),
    opt(tag("creature ")),                                   // axis 2 (optional)
    tag("types"),
))
```

Adding a fifth pronoun (`"our"`) is now a one-token edit to a 4-arm `alt`, not
a doubling of the arm count. `opt(tag("creature "))` also removes the
"longest-alternative-first" ordering footgun — `opt` greedily consumes the
optional segment when present, so the parse is order-independent.

**The smell:** any flat `alt` whose `tag` arms share a long common prefix *and*
a long common suffix is a cross product that didn't get factored. The arm count
should be the *sum* of the per-axis choices (4 + 2 = 6 tokens), never the
*product* (4 × 2 = 8 arms).

---

## 9. When to use the `allow-noncombinator` escape hatch

The gate honors `// allow-noncombinator: <reason>` on a line. **Use it for
genuinely structural string operations, not as a way to avoid writing nom
code.** The reason field is mandatory and should be self-documenting.

Legitimate uses:

- **TextPair dual-string operations**: `TextPair::strip_prefix` is correct
  and required for case-insensitive matching that preserves original casing.
- **Punctuation cleanup on already-chunked input**: e.g. `text.trim_end_matches('.')`
  on the result of `take_until(...)`. Trim with a `char` argument is fine
  (the gate only flags double-quoted string args).
- **Already-tokenized input**: if upstream code already split the input by
  `"` or by sentence, downstream cleanup of those chunks with `strip_*` /
  `trim_end_matches` may be structural.
- **Word-boundary scanning** (pattern 5): a single `.find(' ')` per loop
  iteration to advance to the next token start.

Illegitimate uses (these will be rejected at review even with the
annotation):

- "I'll convert it to combinators later" — there is no later.
- "It's only one card" — every parser change must build for the class.
- "The combinator version is harder to read" — refactor the combinator
  helper instead. The codebase has 100+ existing combinators in
  `oracle_nom/` to model on.

---

## When a new pattern doesn't fit any of the above

1. **Trace an analogous existing combinator.** Grep `oracle_nom/`,
   `oracle_trigger.rs`, `oracle_static.rs`, `oracle_effect/` for similar
   parse shapes. The codebase has hundreds; one almost certainly matches.
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** — the "Rust Idioms" section has the canonical guidance.
3. **Add a new pattern entry to this file** in your PR if you introduce a
   genuinely novel composition. PATTERNS.md is meant to grow — the goal is
   that the next agent who hits the same shape finds the answer here
   instead of reinventing it.
